# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This project is the Week 1 challenge, where I have had to update an existing project with the following chnages required:
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
