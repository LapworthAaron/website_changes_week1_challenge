## Description

<br>
This project was to update a marketing agency's website to conform to accessibility standards and that it's optimised for SEO, this was to be accomplished by completing the following:
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

<br>Repository: https://github.com/LapworthAaron/week1_challenge

This that I changed:
* Consolidated some of the CSS elements, as they were doing the same thing (DRY)
* Gave the SEO div an id, to fix the navigation link
* Updated the HTML tags to be semantic
* add alt text to all the images for screen readers
* Ensured the heading elements were in semantic order
* Updated website title

Consolidating CSS was a new thing i learnt during this process, as well as semantic HTML elements.
